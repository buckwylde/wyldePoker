## Credit where credit due
This project is my C# port of https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator originally written in C/C++.
I can only follow about half of the math, so I've included HenryRLee's explanation in algorithm.md.

I've refactored and modified large chunks of the original code to suit my purposes and to make sure I
actually understood the code (if not the math) and wasn't just copy pasta programming. I only implemented
the 5, 6 and 7 card hand eval functions. The tables for everything else get too big too fast.
