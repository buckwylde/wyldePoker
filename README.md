# wyldePoker solution

## wyldePoker project
Houses my partial C# port/refactor of HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator.
Only ported over evaluate_5, _6 and _7, the hash tables and functions
required for those evaluations. Added C# classes for Deck and Card.

## wyldePokerTest
WinForm test app, just a textbox masquerading as a console output
with buttons for command inputs.

## wyldeLOGIC project
budding collection of generic utility functionality, currently houses
a proper RNG class, and a WIP app settings class.
